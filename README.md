- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @aleksandrnant
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in: I lost connection with Online-Sberbank after disconnecting it from Apple. No updates and no feedback to the personal account in Sberbank Online! MTS communication specialists say that AdGuard VPN blocks communication and does not allow contact via SMS! 
How can this problem be solved?
Respectfully...
P.S. It's not my fault that someone started a war! I'm against all wars in general!!!
